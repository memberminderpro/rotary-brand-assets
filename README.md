   - `rotary-masterbrand-logo.svg`: An SVG file of the Rotary International Masterbrand logo.

## Usage

### CSS Brand Colors

To use the Rotary brand colors in your web project, include the `rotary-brand-colors.css` file in your project. You can then reference the color variables in your CSS files to apply Rotary's official colors to your web elements.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/rotary-brand-colors.css">
```

In your CSS:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--rotary-royal-blue);
}
```

### SVG Files

The SVG files can be used directly in your HTML to display the Rotary text and the Mark of Excellence logo. Ensure that you adhere to Rotary International's guidelines for logo usage and placement.

```html
<img src="path/to/rotary-text.svg" alt="Rotary test">
<img src="path/to/rotary-moe.svg" alt="Rotary Mark of Excellence icon">
```

### Putting it all together

The following is an example useage of the SVG files on a standard html page. Please remember to adhere to the Rotary International guidelines for all usage of these trademarked assets.

## Rotary Brand Colors

> [Rotary’s brand colors](https://brandcenter.rotary.org/en-us/our-brand/brand-elements/colors)[^1] should be used to create a consistent look across all Rotary communications.  Our colors have been carefully chosen to complement one another in most situations and should be used in their pure forms, never altered nor screened. Each color includes formulations for the following uses:
> - Pantone™ colors for print
> - CMYK for 4-color process print
> - Hexadecimal for web
> - RGB for digital
